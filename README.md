# taqiCFD - Fast and Interactive CFD Prediction Tool

taqiCFD is a web-based interactive tool that allows users to simulate and analyze 2D flow around simple geometries using a pre-trained machine learning model. Instead of running complex CFD simulations, taqiCFD provides instant flow predictions based on input geometries and boundary conditions.

## Features

Upload or draw a 2D geometry (circle, square, polygon, etc.).

Configure boundary conditions, such as velocity, pressure, and domain size.

Instant CFD predictions using a pre-trained model.

Interactive UI with multiple tabs, buttons, and visualization tools.

Fast and lightweightâ€”no need for heavy CFD computations.

## Future Additions

Advanced geometry manipulation.

More boundary condition customization.

Export and compare results.
